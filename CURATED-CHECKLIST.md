# Checklist for Curated Projects

## Upload
- Submit one field at a time. Wait for that transaction to clear before attempting the next field.
- When you upload your script, please copy it exactly from testnet.
- Include the following in the Project Base URI field: `https://api.artblocks.io/token/`

## Scheduling
- Art Blocks will work with you to schedule your curated release.

## Mint #0
- Once your project information has been uploaded, please confirm that you're ready for mint #0.
- Mint #0 should occur at least 48 hours in advance of your scheduled release.

## Features
- Please see [FEATURES.md](https://github.com/ArtBlocks/artblocks-docs/blob/main/FEATURES.md) for full details on how you set your project features as an artist.
- The features script for your project should first be tested on the Ropsten testnet (https://artist-staging.artblocks.io/), alongside your art script. Ensure that your features are being displayed as expected on testnet before proceeding to project deployment to mainnet.
- When uploading your feature script to mainnet (https://beta.artblocks.io/), please ensure that you are uploading the exact same features script, taking the same care that you would with your art script itself. 
- While the features script _is not_ stored on-chain like the art script is, bugs in your features script will cause meaningful distruptions for collectors trying to explore your work on a per-feature basis.

## Unpausing
- When it's time, you'll click the Unpause button under the Danger tab.
- Once the transaction clears, your project will be live for minting.

## Rarities
- Do not discuss odds or feature rarities about your project until it is completely sold out.

## Finishing Steps
- Once your project is completely sold out, please reset the Additional Payee Percentage to 0% for any charitable giving that was conducted during minting.
- You may also remove any language from your Project Description that was specifically included to describe sales mechanics.
- We would also appreciate it if you could report back once your charity donations have been completed so that we can log the results.
- Finally, please fill out the appropriate form to add bot-support to your Discord channel for your completed project: https://github.com/ArtBlocks/artbot/issues/new/choose
