# Artist Onboarding Steps

## 1. Application

During one of our open application periods, submit a sample of your project along with your information and an artist statement. Our team will review each submission and reach out to you to get an updated version of your script when it's your turn in the queue.&#x20;

_Timeline: Due to the surge in Art Blocks popularity, applications may take up to several months to process. Applications will be reviewed in the order they were submitted. _

## 2. Script test runs and project review

Our creative team will ask you for an updated version of your project if available, or test the one you submitted with your initial application. We will then decide whether to move forward with a drop.&#x20;

If your project is selected, you'll move into the creator agreement step. If it isn't selected, you'll receive brief feedback and be invited to apply again during our next application cycle.

Note: this stage does not determine if your project will be a curated or factory drop.

_Timeline: 1-2 weeks_

## 3. Creator agreement

A member of our operations team will send you a creator agreement via email to sign. You're officially an Art Blocks artist!

_Timeline: 1-2 days_

## 4. Upload to test net

Once the agreement is in place, you'll be asked to upload your project to the artist staging site on the Ropsten test network. Here you can mint test outputs of your project and work out any kinks in your script before review by the curation board.

We encourage you to mint 40-50 test mints to produce a wide variety before curatorial review. At this stage the creative components of your project should be almost completely finalized and appear the way you would want them to for the official launch.

_Timeline: artist-dependent, but most artists spend about 1 week on this step_

## 5. Review for curation

Our curation board reviews your project and test mints and determines whether it's approved for an Art Blocks Curated release. If not, you'll be able to launch your project on Art Blocks Factory. For more information about the differences between the two, please see our FAQs.

_Timeline: 7-10 days_

## 6. Finalize project for main net

Whether your project is curated or factory, you'll move on to the main net finalization stage and get your project ready for launch on main net. Here you can make any final minor tweaks and ensure everything is finalized for your drop.

_Timeline_: _artist-dependent, but most artists spend about 1 week on this step_

## 7. Finalize project logistics and schedule drop

Decide on the name, edition size, description, price mechanics (dutch auction or fixed price), launch date, and charity for your drop.

_Timeline: 1-2 days_

## 7b. \[Curated projects only] Artist interview

Complete an interview with Jeff Davis, our Chief Creative Officer, before your drop. He'll ask about your background, work as an artist, and your Art Blocks project, and publish it for the community to read.

_Timeline: 1 day_

## 8. Project launch

Congratulations, you made it! Your project is ready to be unpaused and opened for minting.

You can participate in an optional live drop talk session with one of our team members to answer questions and chat with the community while the mints take place.

Once your project is 100% minted, you'll move into our 2 month cool down period, which is the amount of time we require between drops.

_Timeline: typically \~2 weeks after the completion of step 7_
