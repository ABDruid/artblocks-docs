# Artist Onboarding Steps

## 1. Application

During one of our open application periods, submit a prototype of a proposed project along with your your contact information and creative history. Our team will review each submission and reach out to you to get an updated version of your working prototype when it's your turn in the queue.&#x20;

_Timeline: Due to the surge in Art Blocks popularity, applications may take up to several months to process. Applications will be reviewed in the order they were submitted._

## 2. Script test runs and project review

Our creative team will ask you for an updated version of your project if available, or test the one you submitted with your initial application. We will then decide whether to move forward with a launch on Art Blocks.&#x20;

If your project is selected, you'll move into the Creator Terms step. If it isn't selected, you'll receive brief feedback and be invited to apply again during our next application cycle.

Note: This stage does not determine if your project will be a curated or factory project.

_Timeline: 1-2 weeks_

## 3. Creator terms

Our team will send you Art Blocks' Creator Terms via email to sign.

_Timeline: 1-2 days_

## 4. Upload to testnet

Once the terms are signed, you'll be asked to upload your project to the artist staging site on the Ropsten test network. Here you can mint test outputs of your project and work out any kinks in your script before review by the curation board.

We encourage you to mint 40-50 test mints to produce a wide variety before curatorial review. At this stage the creative components of your project should be almost completely finalized and appear the way you would want them to for the official launch.

_Timeline: artist-dependent, but most artists spend about 1 week on this step_

## 5. Curation review

Our Curation Board reviews your project and test mints and determines whether it's approved for an Art Blocks Curated release. If not, you'll be able to launch your project as a regular deployment on Art Blocks Factory. For more information about the differences between the two, please see our FAQs.

_Timeline: 7-10 days_

## 6. Finalizations and upload to mainnet

Whether your project is Curated or Factory, you'll move on to the mainnet finalization stage and get your project ready for launch. Here you can make any final minor tweaks before uploading your project to mainnet.

_Timeline_: _artist-dependent, but most artists spend about 1 week on this step_

## 7. Finalize project logistics and schedule project launch

Lock in series size, price mechanics (dutch auction or fixed price), launch date, and charity component for your project.

_Timeline: 1-2 days_

## 7b. \[Curated projects only] Artist interview

Complete an interview with Jeff Davis, our Chief Creative Officer, to be published before your project launch. This interview will highlight your background, creative history, and your Art Blocks project.

_Timeline: 1 day_

## 8. Project launch

Congratulations, you have made it! Your project is ready to be unpaused and opened for minting.

You can participate in an optional live pre-launch talk with one of our team members to answer questions and chat with the community.

Once your project is 100% minted, you'll move into our cooldown period (2 months between Factory and Playground projects and 6 months between Curated projects), which is the amount of time we require between new project submissions.

_Timeline: typically \~2 weeks after the completion of step 7_
