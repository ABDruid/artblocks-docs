## Unpausing
- When it's time, you'll click the Unpause button under the Danger tab.
- Once the transaction clears, your project will be live for minting.

## Rarities

- You may also remove any language from your Project Description that was specifically included to describe sales mechanics.
- We would also appreciate it if you could report back once your charity donations have been completed so that we can log the results.
